        <h3>In-Place Upgrades from Previous Agent Releases</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For devices that <strong>do not already have an Automox service account</strong>, this change takes effect immediately.</li>
            <li>For devices that <strong>already have an Automox service account in a bad state</strong>, the additional password complexity requirements take effect <strong>after remediation</strong>. See the following section for options to remediate the account:</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Remediation options for devices with an Automox service account in a bad state</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Option 1 - Automated Remediation</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make sure the <code>automox-service-account</code> feature is enabled on the device.</li>
                    <li>Wait for or manually trigger a scan.</li>
                    <li>The agent will delete and recreate the account. This newly created account will have the complex password requirements enabled.</li>
                    <li>This new account still needs to be secure-token enabled.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Option 2 - Manual Intervention</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>As an alternative to Option 1, the Automox service account can be manually deleted by the user.</li>
                    <li>On the next device scan, an Automox service account is recreated automatically. This newly created account has the complex password requirements enabled.</li>
                    <li>This new account still needs to be secure-token enabled.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Option #1 could fail on macOS Monterey devices because Automox might not be able to delete the service account without the terminal having full disk access on the device. The workaround is to use Option #2.<br /></p>
