            <MadCap:toggler targets="WhatsAX;AXInfo;AXInfoLinks">What is Automox?</MadCap:toggler>
        </h2>
        <p MadCap:targetName="WhatsAX">Automox is the first cloud-based patching platform that fully automates the patch remediation process across Windows, macOS, Linux, and third-party software—including Adobe, Firefox, Chrome, and Windows. The platform works across both clients and servers. From “click, set, forget” automation, to complete scheduling and workflow control, Automox enables customers greater security, improved productivity, and radical time savings.</p>

            <MadCap:toggler targets="AXBenefits1;AXBenefits2;AXBenefits3">How is Automox Better than Simply Running Auto-Updates?</MadCap:toggler>
        </h2>
        <p MadCap:targetName="AXBenefits1">Running auto updates is like taking your security policy and dividing it up among each of your employees; and hoping that they patch and maintain their individual systems. This is fine for individuals or very small companies (10 employees or less) but for larger companies Auto Updates is more of a liability than a solution.</p>
        <p MadCap:targetName="AXBenefits2">What you DON’T GET with Auto Updates:
				<ul MadCap:targetName="AXBenefits3"><li>Almost every software has an update feature, making the process of updating software a constant nuisance for the IT manager and the end user.
				</li><li>There is no system (outside of Automox) that combines all of the OS and software updates into a single easy to manage dashboard.
				</li><li>Auto Updates does not give IT a central / single location for reporting on inventory, patch level, configuration settings, or compliance status.
				</li><li>Auto Updates provides no reporting or verification of device status, patches applied, or level of vulnerability.
				</li><li>Auto Updates is inconsistent and unable to force the user to update / install critical security releases.
</li></ul></p>

            <MadCap:toggler targets="AxWorks">How Does Automox Work Behind the Scenes?</MadCap:toggler>
        </h2>
        <p MadCap:targetName="AxWorks">You can think of Automox as a powerful policy-based engine that is constantly evaluating the state of a client or server and checking that state against a predefined policy. If the device or server is found to be out of compliance with a policy, Automox executes a remediation action that brings the client or server back into compliance.

            <MadCap:toggler targets="ReleaseNotes">Where Do I Find Release Notes?</MadCap:toggler>
        </h2>
        <p MadCap:targetName="ReleaseNotes">Please refer to <MadCap:xref href="../Release Notes/Documentation Release Notes/ReleaseNotesLP.htm">Documentation Release Notes</MadCap:xref></p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:toggler targets="AxRepos">Does Automox Host Patch Repositories?</MadCap:toggler>
        </h2>
        <p MadCap:targetName="AxRepos">Automox uses the OS vendor-supplied system update tool to determine which patches are available for a device and to apply those patches at the scheduled time. Automox does not host patch repositories on our servers.</p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:toggler targets="AgentAccess">What Does the Automox Agent Access on a Device?</MadCap:toggler>
        </h2>
        <p MadCap:targetName="AgentAccess">The Automox agent has very limited access to the device and is not natively capable of accessing or removing data or files from it. Compared with other tools like Airwatch and others that have control of the camera, access to the mic, and can intercept data in transit, that is not the intended functionality of Automox. Automox is not as invasive as other tools and can only add, update, and delete software and configuration settings.</p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:toggler targets="WS2008-1;WS2008-2">What Does End of Support for Windows Server 2008 R2 Mean to My Organization?</MadCap:toggler>
        </h2>
        <p MadCap:targetName="WS2008-1">The discontinuation of Windows Server 2008 R2 patch deployment means you will stop seeing new patches every month. As long as vendors continue support for Windows Server 2008 R2, third-party patches, required software, and most Worklets will continue to apply and be relevant.</p>
        <p MadCap:targetName="WS2008-2">If your organization has a need to continue using Windows Server R2, Microsoft offers Extended Security Updates on a per server basis. For more information, see their FAQ: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/extended-security-updates" rel="nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/extended-security-updates</a> </p>
