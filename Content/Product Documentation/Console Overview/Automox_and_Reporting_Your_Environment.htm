        <h1>Automox and Reporting Your Environment</h1>
        <p>Automox has reporting available for you to view and download. Included are our activity log, policy results report, overview report, needs attention, pre-patch report, and data extracts.</p>
        <p>The <b>activity log</b> provides logging and reporting on system events such as policy actions and patch actions.</p>
        <p>The <b>policy results report</b> allows you to view historical data for policy runs in an organization. You can see the success rates and understand which devices had failures so that you can remediate them immediately.</p>
        <p>The <b>overview report</b> provides a device overview, a history of patches applied, and scheduled patches by group and age. This report is designed to be shared with executives and provides a current snapshot of your overall systems vulnerability.</p>
        <p>The <b>pre-patch report</b> shows you a list of all the scheduled patches per device along with severity and exposure information allowing you to effectively assess internal impact.</p>
        <p>The <b>needs attention report</b> gives you a list of devices that need attention along with the relevant information, so you can focus on specific systems issues, saving valuable time and resources.</p>
        <p>The <b>data extracts</b> report provides data such as historical patching activity and audit logs for devices.</p>
