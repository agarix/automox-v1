        <h1>About Ask Otto</h1>
        <p>Ask Otto, powered by Automox Otto AI™, is your generative AI script assistant that writes PowerShell and Bash scripts to help automate configuration and remediation across your environment with Worklets.</p>
        <h2>Ask Otto uses generative AI technologies to write scripts</h2>
        <p>While Otto AI provides the valuable script assistant experience called Ask Otto, it is crucial for you to approach script generation with caution. Generative AI technologies have inherent limitations and should be seen as tools to assist developers rather than complete replacements.</p>
        <p>The script generated by Ask Otto is based on patterns and examples from training data and might not always adhere to specific scripting standards or best practices. We strongly urge you to "trust but validate" the script generated by Ask Otto by carefully reviewing and testing it before implementation.</p>
        <div class="warning"><b>Important</b>: You carry the responsibility for script quality and security for your organization.</div>
        <p>Contact your representative for more information about this feature.</p>
