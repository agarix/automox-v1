        <h1>Creating a Patch Policy</h1>
        <p>Patch policies are used to patch some or all of the software that Automox natively supports.</p>
        <p>From the main console, click <strong>Automate→ Policies.</strong> Click <strong>Create Policy.</strong> The following types of patch policies are available and are described here.</p>
        <div class="info"><b>Note</b>: For information about configuring device targeting, user notifications, or setting a patching schedule, refer to <MadCap:xref href="Device_Targeting_with_Filters.htm">Device Targeting with Filters</MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../Notifications &amp; Restarts/Managing_End_User_Notifications.htm">Managing End-User Notifications</MadCap:xref>, and <MadCap:xref href="Setting_a_Patching_Schedule.htm">Setting a Patching Schedule</MadCap:xref> .</div>

        </p>
        <h2>Patch All</h2>
        <p>Use this policy type to patch all supported software. This includes all operating system patches and supported third-party software.</p>
        <p>To create a Patch All policy, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>From the Policy page, click <strong>Create Policy</strong>.</li>
            <li>From the Create Policy page, click <strong>Patch All</strong>.</li>
            <li>You can now edit the details of the Patch All policy.<br /><strong>Note</strong>: You can use the <strong>Type</strong> menu to switch between patch policy types.</li>
            <li>In the Info area of the Create Patch All Policy page, configure the following:<ul><li>In the <strong>Policy Name</strong> field, enter a unique name for the policy. This field is required.</li><li>In the <strong>Notes</strong> field, enter any notes, if required.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Switch the <strong>Policy Status</strong> to Active or Inactive. This will enable or disable patching. If you want to pause patching, select Inactive.</li>
            <li>To automatically install any Windows updates, choose <strong>Yes</strong> for the <strong>Install Optional and Recommended Windows Update</strong>. The default is No. This allows for the policy to install items that have the optional patch scope condition. (See also <a href="https://help.automox.com/hc/en-us/articles/31577553349012-Can-Automox-Patch-Driver-or-Firmware-Hardware-Updates">Can Automox Patch Driver or Firmware/Hardware Updates?</a>)</li>

        <h2>Severity</h2>
        <p>Use this policy type to select the severity level you want to have included in the patch update: Critical, High, Medium, Low, None, and Unknown. You can select multiple severities. The severity levels are defined by the CVE score. See also <MadCap:xref href="../Patching/Understanding_Automox_Severity_Data.htm">Understanding Automox Severity Data</MadCap:xref>.</p>

        <h3><a name="Package"></a>Package Targeting</h3>
        <p>In addition to setting filters to target specific devices, you can add package targeting to your <strong>patch only</strong>,<strong> patch all except</strong>,<strong> by severity</strong>, and<strong> advanced policies</strong>. This is a custom patching configuration that targets packages according to the filter options that fit your requirements.</p>
        <p>The following are the current options for package targeting for an advanced patch policy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Patch Source (Microsoft, Apple, etc)</li>
            <li>Patch OS</li>
            <li>Type (Windows Only)</li>
            <li>Display Name</li>
            <li>Patch Severity</li>
            <li>Patch Age</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/advanced_policy_pkg.png" class="thumbnail" style="mc-thumbnail-max-height: auto;mc-thumbnail-max-width: 350px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Example for Package Targeting: Patch OS</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the following example, we select <strong>Patch OS</strong> as the first condition which targets all patches based on the OS the device is running. This example is targeting any device that is running Microsoft Windows.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/pakg-target-patchos.png" class="thumbnail" style="mc-thumbnail-max-height: auto;mc-thumbnail-max-width: 350px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Example for Package Targeting: Patch Severity</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can add as many conditions as desired. The policy will continue to refine the list of patches it will remediate it runs on the devices. In the following same example, you can see that <strong>Patch Severity</strong> was added as an additional condition, for which the severity is <strong>Critical</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/pkg-target-patch-sev.png" class="thumbnail" style="mc-thumbnail-max-height: auto;mc-thumbnail-max-width: 350px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Example for Package Targeting: Patch Age</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can also add the option to target only packages that are over a certain number of days old. Use the option <strong>Patch Age</strong> and set a number between 1 and 180. Use this option if you want to only push a patch if the patch was released x number of days ago. This is useful if you do not want to push out brand new patches on your production devices until there has been a period of time that has passed.<br /><strong>Note:</strong> This option is currently only available for Advanced policies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/pkg-target-patch-age.png" class="thumbnail" style="mc-thumbnail-max-height: auto;mc-thumbnail-max-width: 350px;" />
        </p>
        <p>After you configure all of the conditions, to preview the patches that will be remediated by the policy, click <strong>Preview Packages That Would Be Patched</strong>.This will show all of the packages that are targeted by the policy for remediation.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/preview-packages-os.flsnp" />

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/preview-packages.png" class="thumbnail" style="mc-thumbnail-max-height: auto;mc-thumbnail-max-width: 310px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Example for Package Targeting: Patch Only or Patch All Except</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you want to patch only or exclude something containing a specific name, use a patch only or patch all except type and search for that name in the<strong> Filter Package List</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/create-patchonly.png" class="thumbnail" style="mc-thumbnail-max-height: auto;mc-thumbnail-max-width: 350px;" />

        <h2>Creating your first policy</h2>
        <p>If you’re looking for help in creating your first policy, try using the policy template available from the dashboard. The Next Steps guide provides best practices for establishing a 7-day patching cycle with basic (and customizable) policies. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../Console Overview/Automox Console Dashboard.htm">Automox Console Dashboard</MadCap:xref> or refer to the <a href="https://university.automox.com/automation-maturity-playbook/1887294">Automation Maturity Playbook</a> at Automox University.</p>
