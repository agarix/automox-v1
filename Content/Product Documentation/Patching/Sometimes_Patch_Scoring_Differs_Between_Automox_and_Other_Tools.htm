        <h1>Sometimes Patch Scoring Differs Between Automox and Other Tools</h1>
        <p>What to do if there is a discrepancy between the patches Automox shows vs. another tool.</p>
        <p>It is possible that you find a difference between what patches the Automox platform shows and another tool. The reasons for this could be based on the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Automox consumes feeds and scores from sources such as, but not limited to: NVD, Microsoft Security Updates, RedHat, Debian, and Ubuntu.</li>
            <li>Not all sources work the same way or provide the same information.</li>
            <li>Discrepancies are usually due to the policy scopes that have been selected, but can sometimes be due to missing source information or data from an unsupported OS.</li>
            <li>Apple does not release severity data for macOS patches.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What to do?</h3>
        <p>If you see a discrepancy, please <a href="https://help.automox.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">contact Support</a> in our Help Center.</p>
