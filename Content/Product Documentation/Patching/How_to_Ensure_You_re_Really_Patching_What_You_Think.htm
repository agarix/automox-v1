        <h1>How to Ensure You're Really Patching What You Think</h1>
        <p>Review severity settings of policies to make sure you are patching at the scope you want.</p>
        <p>The severity level <strong>High</strong> was added to the Automox console with CSVSSv3, which means you should check if your policies still include the level of patching you are expecting. The scope of <strong>Critical</strong> has a different range (9.0–10.0). If you require the full span of 7.0–10.0, you must select <strong>High</strong> in your policy.</p>

        <h2>How to review your policies</h2>
        <p>Find out if your policies are covering your minimum requirements and adjust the scope.</p>

        <ol start="1">
            <li>From the Automox console, go to <strong>Automate → Policies</strong>.</li>
            <li>For each severity-related policy (Advanced and By Severity policies), click the name of the policy to open the <strong>Edit Policy&#160;</strong>page.</li>
            <li>The Package Targeting section depends on the type of policy:<ul><li>For a <strong>By Severity</strong> policy, select <strong>High</strong> to include the range 7.0–8.9.</li><li>For an <strong>Advanced Policy</strong>, make sure your rules include <strong>Is Greater Than Or Equal To</strong> and <strong>High</strong> to ensure coverage.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Click <strong>Save Policy</strong>. Repeat for each severity-related policy.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="info"><strong>Note</strong>: If you have a policy that has <strong>Critical</strong> selected, we will automatically update your policies to check <strong>High</strong>. This policy should, however, be updated to reflect the new severity options.</div>
