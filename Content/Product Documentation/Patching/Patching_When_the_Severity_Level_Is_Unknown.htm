        <h1>Patching When the Severity Level Is Unknown</h1>
        <p>When a software patch listed in the Automox console shows a severity level of "Unknown", this generally means that Automox was unable to retrieve sufficient information to give it a rating. Additionally, some vendors announce a vulnerability, reserve a CVE, but then do not provide any information. </p>
        <p>To ensure CVEs with no severity score are automatically updated, you can use either a Patch All or an Advanced Policy. We recommend using a <strong>Patch All</strong> policy.</p>
