        <h1>macOS Best Practices: Patch Notifications &amp; CVEs</h1>
        <p>For patch administrators, it is important to know that Apple Inc. does not have a consistent patching schedule for when they release macOS security and feature updates. This is in contrast to Microsoft, who provides Patch Tuesday updates.</p>
        <p>This can create a problem for macOS administrators, because this requires they consistently check their devices if a patch is available, and in some cases, they might get a patch later than their fleet.</p>
        <h2>Patch Notifications</h2>
        <p>There are two ways you can get notifications about new patches for macOS devices.</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Apple has a public security notifications and announcements mailing list you can sign up for. This sends an automatically generated email any time that Apple releases a patch for macOS (this includes patches for iOS, tvOS, etc.).<ul><li>You can sign up <a href="https://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/security-announce/" rel="nofollow">here</a>; please make sure to review the document before subscribing to the mailing list.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Apple also posts all of its security updates and patches <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This page provides patch names, patch information, affected devices, and release dates.<ul><li>This list includes updates and patches for macOS and app updates, such as Safari and Bootcamp.</li><li>Some of these updates also include CVEs in the patch notes, although the CVEs and Severity are not included in the metadata of these patches.</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>CVEs</h2>
        <p>As stated previously, Apple Inc. does not include CVEs in the metadata of patches they release. This can be a pain point for Mac administrators. Automox now includes severity data for native macOS packages. However, updates for applications that are included with macOS are updated as part of the OS update. For example, App Store would be updated when you install the macOS update. Third-party macOS packages are not included at this time.

                        <p>We use the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for severity information. Because the NVD and the Apple security repositories are out of sync, there can be a lag in the list of CVEs that are mapped to packages. The true severity of a patch could be misrepresented.
