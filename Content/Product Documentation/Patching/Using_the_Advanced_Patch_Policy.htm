        <h1>Using the Advanced Patch Policy</h1>
        <p>Automox supports the ability to exclude particular patches or the ability to only deploy patches that match a particular query.</p>
        <p>The advanced patch policy takes this a step further by allowing you to create custom patching configurations by choosing certain conditions that best match the desired compliance requirement for the device. &#160;</p>
