        <h1>Agent 1.43.135/1.43.142 Release Notes</h1>
        <p>This version of the Automox Agent includes improvements to installation and upgrade flows.</p>
        <h2>Improvements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We have improved the installation and upgrade flows for the Automox Agent installer to include a series of Agent functionality checks. If the version being installed does not pass these checks, the installer will ensure that the previously installed version of the agent remains functional. These improvements are currently available for Windows and macOS.
            </li>
            <li>
                The shield icon on macOS notifications has been replaced with the Automox logo.
            </li>
        </ul>
