        <h3>Major Version Number</h3>
        <p>In general, a major version means a release of an Automox agent that contains substantial changes in functionality, code, or compatibility and incorporates any existing previous release or fixes. Unless otherwise specified for a particular product, a version is designated by the number to the left of the decimal point such as 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.</p>
        <h3>Minor Version Number</h3>
        <p>The minor version number means a release of an Automox agent which may contain minor new product functionality, code, or compatibility and incorporates any previous fixes since the last version. Unless otherwise specified for a particular product, a release is tied to the preceding version and is designated by a number to the right of the decimal point such as 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.</p>
        <h3>Patch Version</h3>
        <p>The patch version number means a release of the Automox agent that includes defect fixes only since the last minor release. Unless otherwise specified for a particular product, the patch version is tied to the preceding Major.Minor version and is designated by the number to the right of the minor version number such as 2.1.12, 2.1.25, 2.1.37, etc.</p>
        <h2>Version Support Process/Policy</h2>
        <h3>Active Support</h3>
        <p>From the date Automox releases a new agent version, that agent will be supported for 6 months and then will be end of support and end of life.</p>
        <h3>End-of-Support/Life (EOS/EOL)</h3>
        <p>Customers must update any Automox agent version not covered under Active Support to maintain proper functionality and receive support. EOS indicates the end of active maintenance, EOL marks the retirement of the product altogether.</p>
        <p><strong>End of Support (EOS)</strong> marks the point when we discontinue providing technical support for a specific version of the agent, including patches, bug fixes, and security updates. EOS typically occurs when a newer version supersedes an existing one, phasing out support for the older version as the new release becomes available.</p>
        <p><strong>End of Life (EOL)</strong> signifies the complete cessation of all forms of support, updates, and official documentation for a version of the agent. At this stage, the product is considered obsolete and is no longer available. Before reaching EOL, users are provided with guidance on migrating to newer products or alternatives.</p>
