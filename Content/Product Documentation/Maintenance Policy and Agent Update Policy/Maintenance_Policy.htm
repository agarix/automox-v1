        <h1>Maintenance Policy</h1>
        <p>Automox conducts regularly scheduled preventative maintenance and upgrades to the Automox platform. Monthly maintenance windows can happen on the <b>Thursday of the week following Patch Tuesday</b> each month (barring any other conflicts) <b>from 8 PM - 12 AM Eastern Time (US)</b> for planned maintenance windows, if one is necessary.</p>
        <p>The default duration is approximately <b>4 hours</b>, but it can be expanded if needed, with notice, depending on the nature of the operations.</p>
        <p>We expect intermittent disruptions to the Automox console and API, as well as policy execution, during these maintenance windows.</p>
