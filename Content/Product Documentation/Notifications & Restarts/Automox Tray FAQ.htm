        <h1>Automox Tray and End-User Notifications FAQ</h1>
        <p>These are common questions users may ask, which administrators should be prepared to answer.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:toggler targets="tray">
         Why is there an Automox Tray on my device?
        </MadCap:toggler>
        </p>
        <div MadCap:targetName="tray">
            <p>The tray is required to manage software updates and restart requirements. It is part of your organization’s policy for keeping systems secure and up to date.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            <MadCap:toggler targets="dismiss">
            Can I dismiss or delay a restart notification?
        </MadCap:toggler>
        </p>
        <div MadCap:targetName="dismiss">
            <p>No. Notifications are scheduled based on policy, and cannot be snoozed or turned off. The restart happens automatically if not completed before the deadline.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            <MadCap:toggler targets="restart">
            Why does the tray still show I need to restart even though I already restarted?
        </MadCap:toggler>
        </p>
        <div MadCap:targetName="restart">
            <p>Restarting through the operating system does not satisfy the Automox policy. Users must restart through the Automox Tray for it to be recognized.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            <MadCap:toggler targets="inprogress">
            What if I see "Installation in Progress" for a long time?
        </MadCap:toggler>
        </p>
        <div MadCap:targetName="inprogress">
            <p>This can happen if the device was offline during the scheduled update. A restart from the tray should resolve the status. If it does not, users should contact IT support.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            <MadCap:toggler targets="disable">
            Can I disable the Automox Tray?
        </MadCap:toggler>
        </p>
        <div MadCap:targetName="disable">
            <p>No. The tray is a required component to ensure compliance with IT-managed update policies.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            <MadCap:toggler targets="popup">
            Will there be a way to suppress pop-up reminders from occurring? (For example, a manager wasn’t able to patch in the morning and is about to present for two hours.)
        </MadCap:toggler>
        </p>
        <div MadCap:targetName="popup">
            <p>Not initially.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            <MadCap:toggler targets="custom">
            Can the tray be customized?
        </MadCap:toggler>
        </p>
        <div MadCap:targetName="custom">
            <ul>
                <li>
                The Automox Tray does not support custom notification text from IT admins.
            </li>
                <li>Co-branding (such as company logos) is not currently available.</li>
            </ul>
